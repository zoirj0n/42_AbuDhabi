MiniChat is a messaging app that lets you create real-time chatrooms out of anything you like. Users can pick a limit for how many people can join their room and then chat freely with anyone, anywhere. After 48 hours, chats are erased. Our goal is to be the place where people can have fluid back-and-forth conversations with anyone in the world, without the noise and complexities that exist on platforms such as Twitter. Think Reddit, except more stripped down and visual, with an emphasis on real-time chatting. Or, (as a few users have told us), a more visual Whatsapp for chatrooms.
